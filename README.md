# Statistics: 
Statistics plays a main role in the field of research. It helps us in the collection, analysis and presentation of data. The two main branches of statistics: descriptive and inferential statistics.

Statistics is concerned with developing and studying different methods for collecting, analyzing and presenting the empirical data.

The field of statistics is composed of two broad categories- Descriptive and inferential statistics. Both of them give us different insights about the data. One alone doesnâ€™t not help us much to understand the complete picture of our data but using both of them together gives us a powerful tool for description and prediction.

## Descriptive Statistics: 

Descriptive statistics is about <b> describing our collected data </b>using: measures of center, measures of spread, shape of our distribution, and outliers. We can also use plots of our data to gain a better understanding.

## Inferential Statistics
Inferential Statistics is about using our collected data to <b> draw conclusions to a larger population </b>. Performing inferential statistics well requires that we take a sample that accurately represents our population of interest.

It is necessary to identify the:
1. <b>Population</b> - our entire group of interest.
2. <b>Parameter</b> - numeric summary about a population
3. <b>Sample</b> - subset of the population
4. <b>Statistic</b>- numeric summary about a sample
